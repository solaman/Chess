Objective:
Build a chess application.

Requirements:
Apologies for the untidy form of the project! I'm not 100% sure if the program can run on machines that do not have Windows 8
with 64-bit compatability, but I am 95% sure.

How To Run:
Open the Command Line in the project directory, from there run the command "java -jar Chess.jar".
